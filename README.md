Master's Project for Text Classification project (teamed up with 2 other students)


This is a portion of a class project that I completed with 2 other students through the University of Michigan's Master of Applied Data Science program in Fall 2022. The course emphasized the development and evaluation of supervised and unsupervised learning methods

We used and participated in the course's Kaggle competition which provided over 400,000 sentences extracted from standard and simplified Wikipedia following the guidelines with a split training (containing labels) and a test set (unlabeled) for submission, both of which formed the basis for our dataset.  Our three-person team spent 4 weeks on the project completing the following:

 - Creating a data cleaning and processing pipeline for a final dataset leveraging 3 other auxillary resources assisting with evaluating word difficulty (as defined by what age/grade a person typically learns a particular word) , concreteness of meaning and other resources.
 - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Develop, train and evaluate 7 different classification algorithms using the best parameters found
 - Evaluate the best classifier among the 7 and perform sensitivity, feature importance, feature ablation and error/failure analysis
 - Explore different Unsupervised techniques (I evaluated the use of various clustering techniques while my teammate evaluated based on topic modeling) exploring different methods for tuning and evaluating results


This repo contains my notebooks for the project and a copy of our final project report
